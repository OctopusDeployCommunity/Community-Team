## About Sarah

With a diverse career that spans over fifteen years, Sarah has been a part of every aspect of the IT world. Sarah is a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) and ex-Microsoft employee.

Born and raised on a dairy farm in Scotland, Sarah holds true to her heritage by embracing the natural world through her appreciation for technology. For Sarah, technology is a way to see life as it grows and adapts, ever-changing, just like the natural world of farming.

Sarah is proud to give back to her community. As a STEM Ambassador, Sarah helps others learn how IT can impact and change their lives for the better. Most specifically, she enjoys teaching the next generation of young women how they too can rise in a male-oriented field and succeed in their own careers. Sarah also founded the [Glasgow Azure User Group](https://www.gaug.co.uk), a community collective who meets bimonthly to network and discuss the latest in technology.

Sarahâ€™s enthusiasm in the field of technology has given her the opportunity to speak at public events, most notably, [Microsoft Ignite](https://youtu.be/hXXadtblX_Q).
