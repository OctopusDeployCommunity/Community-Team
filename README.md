## Mission Statement

“To build an inclusive, engaged community of DevOps professionals and aspiring DevOps professionals, making Octopus the default DevOps platform to help everyone succeed with DevOps and their life and career goals.”

## About the Community Team

The purpose of the Octopus Community team is to talk, educate and present to customers and explain how Octopus Deploy works. Sometimes they will  present a webinar based on getting started with Octopus and other days they may need to write about Octopus or integrations with Octopus on our blog.

### Webinars

The Community team runs a webinar every second week on varying topics and we use this as a way to educate and present on Octopus. You can see all of the webinars we run and have ran [Octopus Events Page](https://octopus.com/events).

### Blogs

Blog posts are a great way to share:

- A new solution, hackathon, Community initiative
- Highlight a new feature or step template.
- Explain a new and unique way to leverage existing functionality.  

For example, we may hear of a problem and present a webinar on it, create a sample or a webinar demo that we then present a webinar on it.  We can write a blog about the solution or approach we used. Please speak with the Content Marketing team if you have a blog idea.

### Talks

Talks are a great way to share: 

* New approach or technical idea
* Your personal technical journey
* Your professional journey

An example of this would be someone in the Community team doing a talk on their speciality topic such as Build Servers or Runbooks or a new way to provision Infrastructure as Code on a cloud platform. 

### Attending Events

The Community team will likely be at your local Meetup or conference if Octopus Deploy is present.
